# ***Talkies*** üìΩÔ∏è

"Talkies" is a movie app where users can store their favorite movies, give rates and reviews. 
The names comes from the past where motion pictures with integrated sound were called "talkies". 

### Purpose üí°
The app is used as a library where the user can add their favorite motion pictures. The page fetches some of the information from an API, providing details like movie title, director, release year, imDB rating.

The user can interact with the app by adding or deleteing their movies. They can also add and amend thier own rating or reviews. 

### Setup üíª
"Talkies" is a web app and it requires a browser, internet connection and API KEY.
Create an .env file in which you will pass your API KEY for www.omdbapi.com in this format:

Start your setup by downloading this repository and installing all the dependencies.

The app comes with an empty sqlite database - make sure you can see it in the data directory.

Once everything is in place run the app on a server and start your own library. Just register a new user and log in! 


### Usage üçø
As formentioned, you need to run the app on a server.
You will be asked to log in to see your library, or to first register if you do not have an account.
